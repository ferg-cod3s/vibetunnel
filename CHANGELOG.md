- When you switch branches in your editor/IDE, VibeTunnel automatically switches to the corresponding worktree terminal session
- The `vt follow` command works contextually - run it from either your main repository or a worktree to set up appropriate tracking
- Visual indicators: Fork icon (‚ëÇ) shows worktree sessions, branch names displayed throughout UI
- Follow mode displays worktree paths with `~` for your home directory, making them easier to read
